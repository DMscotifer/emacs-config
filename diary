Apr 30, 2018 First day of Java. Complicated.
Lots of errors.
May 1, 2018 Bear, River, Fish in Java.
Skipped Defcon to watch a movie with Diana. She cut her hair short.
May 3, 2018 Java is really starting to sink in.
Paired with Sarah for a group lab. Went well. We fought more with IntelliJ than with Java.
Diana is off work tomorrow and she suggested a date night. Looking forward to it.

Got started on it in the afternoon. Really should have done it sooner. Struggled a lot.
