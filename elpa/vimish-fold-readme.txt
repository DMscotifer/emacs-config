This is a package to perform text folding like in Vim.  It has the
following features:

* folding of active regions;

* good visual feedback: it's obvious which part of text is folded;

* persistence by default: when you kill a buffer your folds don't
  disappear;

* persistence scales well, you can work on hundreds of files with lots of
  folds without adverse effects;

* it does not break indentation;

* folds can be toggled from folded state to unfolded and back very
  easily;

* quick navigation between existing folds;

* you can use mouse to unfold folds (good for beginners and not only for
  them);

* for fans of `avy' package: you can use `avy' to fold text with minimal
  number of key strokes!
