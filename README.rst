My personal Emacs configuration that builds upon a number of different projects to create a working, universal text editor for development and general purpose computing.

Emacs is a highly customisable text editor programme with its own powerful langauge, elisp (which I do not know).

My configuration has been optimised for my personal xmonad/arch linux setup. discover.el was invaluable in finding 'free' keyboard shortcuts - which you run out of quite quickly using xmonad and emacs together.

Using emacs as an IDE is a work in progress, which is why the .emacs file begins with whimsical ASCII art (at some point I got fed up staring at the same file every other week when first writing, re-writing and copy and pasting configs).

It currently runs with varying success:
* Ruby
* Python
